Task 2
--------------------------------------------------------------
The program needs to simulate a 4 bit calculator, which works
only with whole numbers from 0 to 15. The standard input needs
to be in this order: <digit> <operator> <digit>. The program
needs to work with the following operators: +,-,*,/,%.
--------------------------------------------------------------
The structure of the project contains a header function where
we are setting which methods we are going to use.
In the src folder we have a funtion file where all the methods
are initialized and a main - the starting point of the program.
