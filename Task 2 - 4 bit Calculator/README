Task 2
--------------------------------------------------------------
The program needs to simulate a 4 bit calculator, which works
only with whole numbers from 0 to 15. The standard input needs
to be in this order: <digit> <operator> <digit>. The program
needs to work with the following operators: +,-,*,/,%.
--------------------------------------------------------------
The structure of the project contains a header function where
we are setting which methods we are going to use.
In the src folder we have a funtion file where all the methods
are initialized and a main - the starting point of the program.

Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------
1 - Memory overflow in checkNumber() function. free the strdup
method in the correct place.
2 - Correction for the overflow if the numbers aren't in the
specified range. firstNumber = firstNumber - 16; This is not
correct -> change it with firstNumber &= 0x0F; why?
3 - Read the documentation for sscanf.
