Task 1
--------------------------------------------------------------
The program needs to read a whole number between 0 and 2^32.
It needs to check if the heximal record contains equal digits.
If the digits are equal it retunrs - > YES.
If the digits are not equal it returns - > NO.

Structure
--------------------------------------------------------------
The structure of the project contains a header function where
we are setting which methods are we going to use.
In the src folder we have a funtion file where all the methods
are initialized and a main - the starting point of the program.

Bugs
--------------------------------------------------------------
1 - add missing libraries in main.c and functions.s
2 - memory overflow - see all the malloc functions and fix the
memory allocation.
3 - the program can read number greater than 2^32.
4 - fix checkNumber function. The integer num can't be larger
than 0x7fffffff.
5 - fix memory allocation for heximalNum.
6 - fix compareHex function. There is a problem with srtlen
function, check the two for statements.
7 - This program needs to check if all the hex numbers are equal,
not only two of them.
